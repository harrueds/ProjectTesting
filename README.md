# Testing Projects

This repo is only for testing and working on new projects, don't search order here.

Actually I'm working in a credit scoring project, so I'm using this repo to test the code and make sure it's working as expected.

I don`t implemented CI/CD pipeline... not yet, for me it is obvious.

So, the intention of create this repo is that every human (or bot) can look the process.

Greetings, see you later alligator.
